# Launch a website on Amazon S3 | AWS Project

I will be deploying a website on AWS.
This can also be used for a static website.
This AWS project required the following services:
>Amazon S3, 
>>Amazon Route 53
>>>Domain name registration on AWS or Hostinger.

The website is: thepagesofbello.space

This page also shows my Frontend Web Dev Skills alongside my AWS Cloud Project.

I plan toe improve on the page and incorporate links to my other pages in the future.

Cheers!!!
